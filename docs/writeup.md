# Logger.Fitness 31/12/2021
This idea originally came to me from my honours project which I had in my last
year of University. The idea was a two-parter, to make a workout logger
application and to make the app in a micro services approach. This proved to be
a bit of a time waste because I did not end up properly finishing the application.
So here I am with my second run at this idea.

## The Idea
The idea is simple, make a fuss-free workout logging application which is
customisable in the exercises that you have and the data that you have available.
Then be able to take logs and create custom historical charts based cross
referencing data that the user wants.


The user would be able to add tags to things such as exercises, or
workouts. Then, the user would be able to create a graph where it would be able
to pull in data which has that specific tag on it and show progress over time
with or without that tag.


For example, the user could tag a specific workout with tag "super tired". Then 
when compiling a graph the user could exclude that specific tag from the search.
This logic could be extended to include tags, and multiple exercises types.


However, to even think about starting the sort of data and tag magic which has 
been described above, a base logger would first have to be made, or an MVP.

### v1.0 MVP
This MVP is all about making a functional logger where you would be able to just
simply create custom exercise types, with two types of data (single values and
sets). Then be able to start workouts, log the exercises, log notes and stop the
workouts.
